# Weighted Sensor Selection Using Binary Auto-Encoders in Industrial Systems

## Abstract

The increasing reliance of industrial systems on sensory data for state estimation calls for effective methods of selecting sensors. In this paper, we propose a method of selecting sensors based on the information provided by the sensor and the associated cost. A simulation of signals was conducted to compare the sensor selection using a unit sensor-cost vector, which assumes equal cost for all sensors, and a designed sensor-cost vector. The results show that our proposed model is capable of selecting the appropriate sensor combination that minimizes the overall system cost. This study has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of sensor selection for system design, particularly in the context of state-estimation. The technique employed in this study can also be applied to feature selection more broadly.
